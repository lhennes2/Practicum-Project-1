# About the Project

The goal of this project is to enhance the way we present information online.  PageDip allows users to build pages that combine elements of static documents with elements of web pages, allowing users to enjoy the best of both formats.  PageDips are interactive like a webpage, but encourage viewers to follow through beginning to end like a document.  And they provide rich data on views and interactions with the 20+ types of embedded widgets.

Specifically I'll be testing widgets and PageDips for accurate recording of data, and investigating any idiosycracies that the widgets may have, as well as how they are used by users and viewers.  I'll also be developing an index of document engagement for users, so that they can predict how strongly their PageDip will engage viewers before they publish.  

## Built With

- Python

## Getting Started

Download attached data.

## Roadmap

- Perform EDA on the data to understand structure, important columns, interactions.
- Testing PageDips for proper data recording.
- Investigate widgets for idiosyncracies in reporting, patterns of use by users, patterns of interaction by viewers.
- Use cluster analysis to identify distinct performance tiers.
- Forumulate an engagement index of engagement indices, as appropriate.
